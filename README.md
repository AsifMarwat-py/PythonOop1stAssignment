# ATM Simulation Assignment

This project is an ATM simulation created as an assignment for the **Advanced Python** course offered by **NAVTTC** at **Islamia College University Peshawar**.

## Overview

This Python program simulates basic ATM functionalities, including:
- Creating a PIN
- Depositing balance
- Withdrawing balance
- Checking balance

## Objective

The objective of this assignment was to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. We were tasked with creating a class based implementation of an ATM system that interacts with the user and manages basic banking operations securely.

## Key Features

- **PIN Creation and Verification**: Users can create a numeric PIN, which is required for all subsequent transactions.
- **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Users can deposit and withdraw money after entering their correct PIN.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can check their current balance, provided they enter the correct PIN.
- **Secure Transactions**: All operations are secured with PIN verification to ensure that only authorized users can perform transactions.

## Course Information

- **Course**: Advanced Python
- **Offered By**: NAVTTC
- **Institution**: Islamia College University Peshawar
- **Instructor**: Atif Khan
- **Assignment**: First assignment on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Usage

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system. Simply execute the script in a Python environment and follow the on-screen instructions to perform different ATM operations.

```bash
python oopatm.py
